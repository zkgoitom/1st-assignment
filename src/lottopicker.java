        /* programming is the combination off iteratives and conditions

        // control flow - different types of statements that affect the flow of a program
            iterative -loops:
                while loop- while a conditino is true, keep executing
                do while loop- similar to a while loop, guaranteed to run once

           Condition -
            if- checks if a condition is tru,it will execute once
            else (tandem with an if)- executes if an if statement is false
